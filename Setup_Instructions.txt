Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up & Run the BCI Project

1. Download & Save Files:
   - Create a folder named "BCI_Project_Final".
   - Inside this folder, create the following subfolders:
     a. data   (Place your EEG dataset file here, e.g., eeg_data.fif)
     b. results (This folder will store the output model)
   - Save the following files in "BCI_Project_Final":
     - Research_Paper.pdf (or Research_Paper.docx) – containing the 100-page research paper
     - bci_model.py – the Python source code
     - Setup_Instructions.txt – these instructions

2. Install Required Software & Libraries:
   - Install Python 3.x from https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and install required libraries by running:
     pip install numpy pandas mne tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib

3. Run the Project Code:
   - Navigate to the "BCI_Project_Final" folder in your terminal.
   - Run the code with the command:
     python bci_model.py
   - The script will:
      a. Load and preprocess EEG data.
      b. Train a CNN model.
      c. Evaluate the model and display results.
      d. Save the trained model in the "results" folder.

4. Review the Research Document:
   - Open the Research_Paper.pdf (or .docx) to review the detailed project documentation.

5. Troubleshooting:
   - Verify that the EEG dataset file is correctly placed in the "data" folder.
   - Ensure all required libraries are installed.
   - Check the terminal output for any error messages.
